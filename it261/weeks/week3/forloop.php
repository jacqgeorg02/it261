<?php
// from the W3 schools
// for (init counter; test counter; increment counter) {code to be executed for each interation; }
// in the for loop there are 3 statements inside -- initializing the loop counter value, the 2nd is the test counter, and increment counter is how many things do you want to count by

// <? php
// for ($x = 0; $x <=10; $x++) {
// echo "The number is: $x <br>";
// }

// This is an example that the counter value 0 is applied to x and then we say that x can be less than or equal to 10 and then count by one -->
